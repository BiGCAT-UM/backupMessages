    below about the status of our BiGCaT services.
    
    <h2>6 January 2020</h2>
    <p>
      Because of a <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/news/update-cyber-attack-um">security incident</a>
      at the Maastricht University, the network is isolated from the outside world
      and several BiGCaT servers are offline. At the moment, it is unclear when these services will be restored. 
      You can follow one or more of our Twitter accounts to receive direct updates.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Working services:</h3>
    
    <h4>WikiPathways website and data download</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways"> WikiPathways website </a> is online and can be used. 
      <a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Download_Pathways"> Pathway data </a> can be downloaded as well .
    </p>
    
    <h4>BridgeDb webservice</h4>
    <p><a href="http://webservice.bridgedb.org/">The BridgeDb webservices </a> are online and can be used.

    <h3>NOT Working services:</h3>
    
    <h4>PathVisio.org</h4>
    <p>The PathVisio website is unreachable, along with the data.pathvisio.org website hosting the BridgeDb identifier
    mapping databases. You can <a href="https://github.com/PathVisio/pathvisio/releases"> download </a> PathVisio from our Github release page. 
    For <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10048508"> metabolite mappings </a>, Figshare has an archived version of a recent mapping file.
    This is also the case for <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8167565"> interactions mappings</a> .
    The BridgeDb webservice includes these latest files, as well as Gene+Protein mappings.

    <h4>WikiPathways SPARQL endpoint</h4>
    <p>The WikiPathways SPARQL endpoint is also unreachable (<a href="https://www.wikipathways.org/">WikiPathways.org</a> is not affected). We currently do not have an alternative,
    but one option is to <a href="http://data.wikipathways.org/20191210/rdf/">download the RDF data</a>
    and load this in a local Virtuoso or Blazegraph installation.</a>.
